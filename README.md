## Usage

At root of project in a terminal run:

```
node ./src/index.js <expression>
```

Where te `<expression>` is a math expression you wanto to calculate.  
Obs: When using multiplications call the expression inside quotes `""` because the `*` is used to list the directories and it will not be identified as the multiplier operator.

### Expressions examples

```
node ./src/index.js 5 + 3 - 6
```

```
node ./src/index.js 2 ^ 5 / 16
```

```
node ./src/index.js "3 * 9 - 7"
```

| `+`    | Add       |
| `-`    | Subtract  |
| `*`    | Multiply  |
